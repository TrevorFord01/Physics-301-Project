"# Physics-301-Project"

This repository contains all of the work and notebooks I use to complete the project for Physics 301, Computational Physics,
offered in the Fall 2020 semester. My goal is to have several notebooks explaining the background mathematics and physics in
detail, as well as code that produces animations for waves on circular, rectangular, and triangular membranes with fixed edges.
